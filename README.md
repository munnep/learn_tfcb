# Week 1
[Week1](week1/README.md)

## What you liked ?
Going over the material and sometimes hit something and be like "Oh now I get it"

## What was new to you ?
The slice function was good to see how to use it. Python course made me like "oh...that is how you can do it in terraform with slice" and the terraform lock file overview was a good reminder.

## What was wow ?
Same as from the tickets last few weeks. Use locals more often in your code to simplify things. 

# learn_tfcb
# Week 2
[Week2](week2/README.md)

## What you liked ?
Really liked the presentation of Terraform Cloud by the 2 Hashicorp engineers. They explained why Terraform Cloud exists. For small teams and easy to use and then work with your colleagues on Terraform to use it. 

Very small thing with sentinel was good to do. 

## What was new to you ?
Realized again to create docker images and start containers using a docker provider for terraform. 

## What was wow ?
This week nothing stood out. 

# learn_tfcb
# Week 3
[Week3](week3/README.md)

## What you liked ?
This was a week with some exercises I didn't do before. The kubernetes, vault, consul exercise with google cloud was challenging. Turned out eventually the code used is to old to successfully complete the exercise. This will be solved by the education team

## What was new to you ?
Terraform cloud and Vault exercise was great to see. How vault created temporary tokens in Cloud to use. Hadn't seen it before. 

## What was wow ?
Don't expect the exercises will work. They could fail because of new versions or changes in providers or the clouds itself.  

# learn_tfcb
# Week 4
[Week4](week4/README.md)

## What you liked ?
This is one of the hardest weeks so far get through. There are a lot of things that don't work anymore because of different reasons like

- Kubernetes is a higher version then expected
- The consul version needed to be upgraded
- Other things not working where the education team will be looking at. 

## What was new to you ?
Vault and Consul options and usage along with Terraform. 

## What was wow ?
Need to come back to a few tasks for different reasons

- Codify Management of Vault Enterprise Using Terraform - Need to have a look with Daniela because of Vault Enterprise usage.
- Approle with Terraform and Chef - didn't work. Education team is taking a look
- Manage VMs and Snapshots on vSphere  - Do not have a vSphere environment
- Deploy Applications with the Helm Provider - Final step not possible. Slack doesn't allow this. Everything before that worked. 
- Automate Monitoring with the Terraform Datadog Provider - Some Error where the education team will take a look

# learn_tfcb
# Week 5
[Week5](week5/README.md)

## What you liked ?
Some Terraform things you don't do every day and practice it again. 

## What was new to you ?
The Terraform plan/apply -refresh-only command made things more clear with the exercises

## What was wow ?
Big difference with the exercises from week 4

# learn_tfcb
# Week 6
[Week6](week6/README.md)

## What you liked ?
Using CircleCI was fun because I had a demo with CircleCI just last week at CfgMgmt Camp. It was almost the same exercise and because I knew a bit more I could sidestep the issues I had because of the AWS credentials. 

The github actions was great. Had no idea this was possible and doing the exercise didn't work out of the box. There was an issue in the yaml file but was able to change it and get it working. Created a issue with solution on the original repo. 

## What was new to you ?
Github Actions

## What was wow ?
Seeing the Github actions work
