# Week 1
[[Week1](week1/README.md)]

## What you liked ?
Going over the material and sometimes hit something and be like "Oh now I get it"

## What was new to you ?
The slice function was good to see how to use it. Python course made me like "oh...that is how you can do it in terraform with slice" and the terraform lock file overview was a good reminder.

## What was wow ?
Same as from the tickets last few weeks. Use locals more often in your code to simplify things.

# Week 2
[[Week2](week2/README.md)]

## What you liked ?
Really liked the presentation of Terraform Cloud by the 2 Hashicorp engineers. They explained why Terraform Cloud exists. For small teams and easy to use and then work with your colleagues on Terraform to use it. 

Very small thing with sentinel was good to do. 

## What was new to you ?
Realized again to create docker images and start containers using a docker provider for terraform. 

## What was wow ?
This week nothing stood out.
