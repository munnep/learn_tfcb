# Week 1
[Week1](week1/README.md)

## What you liked ?
Going over the material and sometimes hit something and be like "Oh now I get it"

## What was new to you ?
The slice function was good to see how to use it. Python course made me like "oh...that is how you can do it in terraform with slice" and the terraform lock file overview was a good reminder.

## What was wow ?
Same as from the tickets last few weeks. Use locals more often in your code to simplify things.
